}
\arguments{
\item{raw.data}{Expression data from raw FCS files. Cells in rows and
detectors in columns. Columns should be fluorescent data only and must
match the columns in spectra.}

\item{spectra}{Spectral signatures of fluorophores, normalized between 0
and 1, with fluorophores in rows and detectors in columns.}

\item{af.spectra}{Spectral signatures of autofluorescences, normalized
between 0 and 1, with fluorophores in rows and detectors in columns. Prepare
using \code{get.af.spectra}.}

\item{spectra.variants}{Named list (names are fluorophores) carrying matrices
of spectral signature variations for each fluorophore. Prepare using
\code{get.spectral.variants()}. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{flowcode.spectra}{Structured output from \code{get.flowcode.spectra()}, which
details the combination-level spectral unmixing errors due to FRET-like
artefacts.}

\item{asp}{The AutoSpectral parameter list. Prepare using
\code{get.autospectral.param}.}

\item{thresholds}{Optional named numeric vector of positivity thresholds for
the FlowCode fluorophores. Overrides the thresholds provided by \code{flowcode.spectra}.
Default is \code{NULL}, which is unused.}

\item{weights}{Optional numeric vector of weights (one per fluorescent
detector). Default is \code{NULL}, in which case weighting will be done by
channel means (Poisson variance).}

\item{cell.weighting}{Logical, whether to use cell-specific weighting for a
more Poisson-like unmixing. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{cell.weight.regularize}{Logical, whether to regularize cell-specific
weights towards the bulk mean weighting set by \code{weights}. 50:50 averaging.
Default is \code{TRUE}. Only active if \code{cell.weighting=TRUE}.}

\item{k}{Numeric, controls the number of variants tested for each fluorophore,
autofluorescence and FRET spectrum. Default is \code{1}, which will be fastest.
Values up to \code{10} provide additional benefit in unmixing quality.}

\item{parallel}{Logical, whether to use parallel processing for the per-cell
unmixing. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{threads}{Numeric. Number of threads to use for parallel processing.
Defaults to \code{1} for sequential processing, or \code{0} (all cores) if \code{parallel=TRUE}.}

\item{verbose}{Logical, whether to send messages to the console.
Default is \code{TRUE}.}
